# calendar-application
Welcome to the calendar-application where you can fill out your daily work schdule for your busy day ahead!
Before starting I created a new repository on GitHub and cloned it to my computer. 
For this assignment we were given a tiny bit of starter code for the html and css.
In html I used bootsrap to create my timeblocks for the calendar.
Next I displayed bt time blocks with AM time starting at 9 going till 5PM
Now that I have that completely I can work fully on the JavaScript part.
In JavaScript I started with created my local storage.
I create a function for when I press the save button everything in the text area will get saved.
Give it a try! If you go to 10AM and write "meeting" press save and they refresh the page.
Once it's refreshed it reappears!
You can also go right click to Inspect, Application, Local storage file:// and see it also saved there as well. 
Next came my timeUpdater function.
Depending on what time of the day it is your schdule blocks will come up a specific color.
Grey for past time, red for current, and green for the future.
And last on my JavaScript you can find my displayTime function which shows you the current time in hh:mm:ss format at the head of your schdule. 
Next using Gitbash I push my final work to my GitHub where I create my deploy site under settings.
Once that is completed I go to my Bootcamp spot and submit my deplyed URL and my GitHub URL under Module 5 Challenge.
